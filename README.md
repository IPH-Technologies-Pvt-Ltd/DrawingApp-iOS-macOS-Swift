## Finger Movement Tracking and Line Drawing
Strokescape allows you to effortlessly create beautiful drawings by tracking the movement of your finger. As you move your finger across the screen, the app responds in real-time, letting you draw smooth and dynamic lines.

## Draw Line
For precision and accuracy, Strokescape includes a straight-line drawing feature. Simply activate this option, and you'll be able to draw perfectly straight lines with ease. This is particularly useful for technical drawings and clean designs.

## Undo and Redo
Mistakes happen, and that's why Strokescape includes an undo and redo functionality. If you're not satisfied with a stroke or change your mind, simply use the undo feature to step back in time. And if you change your mind about your undo action, the redo feature has your back.

## Eraser
Correcting errors is a breeze with the built-in eraser tool. Choose the eraser from the tool palette, and you can easily remove unwanted lines or marks from your drawing. Keep your creations looking polished and professional.

## Clear
When you want to start fresh, the clear or move to bin feature comes to the rescue.
